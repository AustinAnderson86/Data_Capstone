## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908)
str(Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908)
```

##Discovery 

```{r}
Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908$Location
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(data = Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908, aes(x = Date, y = Aboard))+geom_point(aes(color = Fatalities))


ggplot(data = Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908, aes(x = Time, y = Aboard))+geom_point(aes(color = Fatalities))

ggplot(data = Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908, aes(x = Time,, y = Fatalities))+geom_point(aes(color = Date))

ggplot(data = Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities_Since_1908, aes(Location, fill = Time)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") +  facet_wrap(~Date)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
